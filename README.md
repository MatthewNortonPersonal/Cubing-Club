# HHS-Cubing-Club
The (current) official site for HHS Cubing Club.

This is a web page that will contain resources for learning
how to solve a 3x3 rubik's cube, as well as other puzzles of
similar nature.

The plan is to have presentations and links for the best ways 
to learn how to solve the cube as a resource to teach people
how to solve one in addition to our in-person teaching.

This webpage will be open for anyone to see, so it is not 
solely limited to those attending Hopkins High School.
